# 📝 Task Manager

A task management application built with **React** on the frontend, **Material UI** for styling, **AWS Amplify** for deploy, **AWS Lambda** + **MongoDB** on the backend. This application allows you to create, edit, delete, and organize tasks efficiently, perfect for staying productive and focused on your daily goals.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend
- ⚛️ **React** – Library for building user interfaces.
- 🎨 **Material UI (MUI)** – React component library for fast and beautiful UI development.
- ☁️ **AWS Amplify** – Hosting and CI/CD for the frontend.

### Backend
- 🧠 **AWS Lambda + MongoDB Atlas** – Serverless functions for backend logic and data persistence.
- 🖥️ **API Gateway** – Exposing Lambda functions as RESTful endpoints.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Add new tasks.
- ✏️ Edit existing tasks.
- 🗑️ Delete tasks.
- 📌 Mark tasks as completed / in progress / pending.
- 📊 Display tasks in a chart.
  
## ⚙️ Run Locally

To run both projects with Docker:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/task-manager.git
   cd task-manager
   ```

2. Ensure you have **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed.

3. Use Docker Compose to bring up the containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

This will build and bring up both the frontend and backend in separate containers. You can access the application from `http://localhost:3000` (frontend) and the backend will be accessible through the defined API Gateway endpoints.

## 📦 Docker

### Dockerfile for Frontend (React)

```Dockerfile
# Frontend Dockerfile

# Use a Node.js base image
FROM node:18-alpine

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json
COPY frontend/package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the files
COPY frontend/ .

# Run the build command
RUN npm run build

# Expose port 3000
EXPOSE 3000

# Command to start the server
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Dockerfile for Backend (AWS Lambda + API Gateway)

```Dockerfile
# Backend Dockerfile

# Use a Python base image
FROM python:3.9-alpine

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the backend files
COPY backend/ .

# Install Python dependencies
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Expose port 5000 for the server (if using Flask or similar)
EXPOSE 5000

# Command to start the backend (if using Flask, for example)
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

### Docker Compose

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  frontend:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.frontend
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - backend

  backend:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.backend
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    environment:
      - MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017
    depends_on:
      - mongo

  mongo:
    image: mongo
    volumes:
      - mongo_data:/data/db
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"

volumes:
  mongo_data:
```

### Deployment Instructions

1. **Docker Compose**: Both projects can be deployed together using `docker-compose` to manage the containers.

2. **AWS Amplify (Frontend)**: The frontend is configured to be deployed to AWS Amplify, which makes it easy to integrate and auto-deploy on each push to the main branch.

3. **Backend (AWS Lambda)**: The backend is deployed to AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Follow the instructions to upload the code to Lambda and associate HTTP methods in API Gateway.
